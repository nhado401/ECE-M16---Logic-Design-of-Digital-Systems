The goal of this project is design a digital circuit that implements a common type of image filter known as a pooling filter (also known as a pooling layer). 
This type of filter is employed to reduce the size of an input image while keeping relevant features of the input and discarding irrelevant information, such as noise.
It reads a 512x512 input image from a file, applies the implemented pooling function at each window position for each color channel, then writes the resulting 256x256 output image.
